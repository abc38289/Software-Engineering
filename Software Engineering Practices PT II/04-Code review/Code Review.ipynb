    "Here is a sample solution. Your solution may differ slightly. <br><br><li>Does the code use meaningful names and whitespace? While the code is fairly short and easy to follow thanks to the use of good whitespace, it's not totally clear what is going on and this could be improved with descriptive variable names. <br><li>Are there loops or other steps I can vectorized? It looks like the for loop could be vectorized to improve performance a considerable amount. <br><li>Is there complex code that's missing documentation? In general, there seems to be a lack of documentation. Given that the code is short there is likely not much documentation that is needed, but having a better indication of what the code is doing (and why) would be helpful. <br><li>Does the code have test coverage? There was no test file shown, so the assumption would be that this code has not been thoroughly tested. <br><li>Are log messages clear, concise, and professional? This code contains no log messages."
